# Wanderlust
A fully responsive desktop app to explore city destinations around the world by fetching images, current weather data, sights and restaurants from different APIs (OpenWeather API, Foursquare API, Unsplash API).

## Technologies used
- HTML, CSS Bootstrap, JavaScript, Webpack, dotenv
- Deployed with Netlify

## Description
Wanderlust relies on working with async JS, third-party APIs, JSON, and rendering the results with HTML DOM.
It is bundled with Webpack.

## Inspiration
This project is based on an exercise in the Front-End Engineering course from codecademy.com. I expanded on the functionality by integrating other APIs and visuals.
